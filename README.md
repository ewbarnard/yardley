## Book Title

*Here Be Dragons: Finding the Joy in Software Development* by Edward Barnard (a php[architect] anthology, 2021).

## Amazon Description

How do you develop *yourself* as a software developer? How do you become the expert over and over again, year after year? How do you keep this *fun*? Here's the path for you to solve this for yourself once and for all.

There's a strong tendency toward "gate keeping" right now in the 2020s. Senior developers warn "there be dragons" while announcing a "hands off" policy toward the critical areas of the code base. You and I need to get past that. Where's the fun when you can't touch the dragons? The joy's in *experiencing* software development, dragons and all.

My expertise has always been in diving deep, figuring things out that others don't. That's a primary skill I'm here to share. We'll practice that skill throughout the book.

We begin with learning what it was like among the wizards of Cray Research, working with Seymour Cray's CRAY-1 supercomputer. When I gave a conference talk about "the Cray," I got a surprise! The talk went right over peoples' heads---because, I thought, the old skills have been lost. But I discovered there's a way of thinking that's been nearly lost as well.

Have you encountered any of those "simple" coding challenges often part of a software-development interview? Those challenges look for that same nearly-lost way of thinking. The first half of this book focuses on the "meta skills" of learning to learn and learning to think, culminating in that crucial skill of learning to think like a computer thinks. Be warned, this first half will challenge you. There be dragons.

Now comes that fork in the road where you could become a gatekeeper yourself. Rather than becoming elitist or dismissive, the book's second half shows you how to find ways of bringing others up to your level. You'll have more fun---and won't have to be the only one taking the support calls.

At some point code is code. The details don't matter. In that case, what *does* matter?

What matters is the ability---and willingness---to learn. I find that once I become the expert in something, that skill is often no longer needed. It's on to the next big thing! What's needed, I find, is the ability to gain the next expertise, and the next, and the next.

What do we need to know about the ongoing Big Tech litigation and antitrust concerns? My answer is the same; we'll take a deep dive into some interesting situations to gain that expertise. It's not easy to work ethically in an often ethics-free environment.

Now, finally, we come to the lesson that, for me, came first---but it took a lifetime to understand this was my foundation for a career in software development. I've never seen the tenets of Experiential Education directly applied to Software Development. This is how I first learned to handle the dragons.

This book does not teach specific coding techniques. The details change from decade to decade. We're here to Develop the Developer, so to speak, enabling you to gain that expertise in the first place, guiding your own path through one stage to the next. Take joy in the journey; have fun with your hard-won expertise. Gain that "been there, done that" confidence and you'll do well.

## Preface

Developing real skill, to the point of mastery, requires deliberate practice. You can't get that from a book. However, a book *can* act as a guide. In the mountaineering world, for example, guidebooks share the experience of climbers who have climbed the route before you. They tell you what you need to know, but *you* still need to climb the route yourself. A guidebook's information may be indispensable, but the book won't carry you up the mountain.

There's a skill we *can* practice right here in the book. We'll be taking deep dive after deep dive to learn how it really was or learn how something works "under the covers." I'll do my best to make things heavy going while keeping it fun. For my part I'm having fun providing you the challenge!

### Part I: Cray Research

At Cray Research we built the world's fastest computers. Period. We all saw that mission as larger than ourselves. Being pioneers we *expected* to have to find our own way, and we did.

That attitude's as important as the willingness to learn and find solutions. In sharing what that world was like, I'm sharing that attitude. We'll meet some useful skills along the way such as double buffering and cache locality. I'll show you the technique I call "finding patterns in the noise." It's paid off countless times. We'll have fun with an actual game of horseshoes inside a spotless computer room in the middle of the night at NSA headquarters, but don't tell anyone!

### Part II: The Almost-Lost Skills

Here are some hard-core skills rarely seen these days except amongst people who develop compilers or write microcontrollers for robotics, aircraft avionics, or the like. Certainly there are bragging rights available to those who can do shifting and masking in their heads. But we're heading for something far more important, more fundamental, more subtle.

The real skill is learning how a computer "thinks," to identify with how things work *from the computer's perspective.* Other skills are important, absolutely, but this is a foundation on which you can build the rest. I'm providing you the path distilled from my 50 years' experience with computers.

### Part III: Ethics and Antitrust

The Silicon Valley and Seattle "Big Tech" conglomerates have become too big to succeed. Ethics and other moral values have lost their relevance. Now, in the early 2020s, U.S. States' Attorneys General are lining up with antitrust complaints. The powerful 19th Century transcontinental railroads provide the announced game plan for sorting out Silicon Valley. That fact is weird, so naturally we'll take a deep dive and have fun with it!

### Part IV: Learning to Experience

I learned the concept of Experiential Education directly from World War II veteran and mountaineer Willi Unsoeld, a leading founder of that philosophy. I'll share his hilarious tryout for the first U.S. expedition to the top of Mount Everest. Then I'm bringing you to my own winter summit of Mount Rainier, a feat as rare today as it was back then.

That sounds weird for a book on developing a software career. Unsoeld's wife Jolene placed this in perspective for me decades later: it's learning to *experience* the journey that makes it special, that creates a career, that surfaces the joy amongst the dragons. Success only comes with planning and serious preparation; only experience brings mastery of the craft. That lesson, I discovered, remains the same whether it's on a mountain or in front of a keyboard or whiteboard.
